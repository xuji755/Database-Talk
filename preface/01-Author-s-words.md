# 前言

数据库技术是包罗万象的，三十年前，我从大学里毕业后加入了当时世界上的第二大计算机公司-“数字设备公司（DEC）”，担任软件专员。实际上主要工作有两大块，一块是为DEC香港的客户做软件外包，另外一块是帮助DEC中国的售后服务机构做OpenVMS方面的培训。我十分感谢在DEC深圳软件中心的不到两年的工作时间，让我实现了从一名大学毕业生到程序员的转变。

离开DEC之后，我依然从事软件开发工作，不过因为在赛格计算机公司的工作经历，让我多了一些售前的经验。我的主业并不是做软件开发，而更多的是参与一些项目的售前方案制定，这些经历让我对系统的理解超出了软件的范畴。 随后我开始了自己的几次创业，都是以软件为核心，我和我的伙伴成为了国内最早的电信计费账务系统的开发者，也参与了大量政府的MIS系统建设，最后几年的程序员生涯里，我加入了一个做银行CORE BANKING研发的团队，让我对金融核心系统也有了一点点了解，我也利用了我在电信行业的一些经验帮助那个团队重新设计了银行大前置系统，通过应用路由使CORE BANKING系统变成了一个能够方便组装的系统。 

以上的这些经历，让我这个后来专职从事数据库优化工作的DBA变得和其他人不太一样。很多朋友夸我“博学”，实际上谈不上博学，仅仅是“杂”而已。正是我这三十年的工作经验够杂，再加上我这三十年一直不愿意放弃技术，到现在还在解除一线的数据库技术，所以我今天能够开始编著这本《数据库杂谈》。 杂书是最好写，最难编的。写起来可以天马行空，但是编起来才发现不易。要做到杂而不乱是十分困难的，再杂也必须有明确的主题，并且让所有的内容都能够与这个主题相呼应，这样才能让杂书也看起来有味道。这对于我来说也是一个挑战，不过我还是愿意接受这个挑战。自从我开始在微信公众号上写东西开始，数据库方面的文章也有七八百篇了。这些文章虽然杂，但是都是我的所思所想，对和错都是我自己的思想的产物。很多东西不一定就完全正确，但是它也是一种思考。人只要动脑子思考了，那么这些文字应该就是有点价值的。希望这些杂文能够对读者有所帮助。





# Author's words

Database technology is all-encompassing. Thirty years ago, after graduating from college, I joined the world's second largest computer company - "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)" as a software specialist. In fact, there are two main tasks. One is to provide software outsourcing for DEC Hong Kong customers, and the other is to help DEC China's after-sales service organizations with OpenVMS training. I am very grateful to the less than two years of working at DEC Shenzhen Software Center, which allowed me to realize the transformation from a college graduate to a programmer.

After leaving DEC, I was still engaged in software development, but my work experience at SEG Computer Company gave me more pre-sales experience. My main business is not software development, but more involved in the formulation of pre-sales plans for some projects. These experiences have allowed me to understand the system beyond the scope of software. Then I started several businesses of my own, all with software as the core. My partners and I became the earliest developers of telecommunications billing and accounting systems in China, and also participated in the construction of a large number of government MIS systems. In the last few years During my career as a programmer, I joined a team that was doing research and development on CORE BANKING, which gave me a little understanding of the core financial system. I also used some of my experience in the telecommunications industry to help the team redesign the bank's core system. The CORE BANKING system has been transformed into a system that can be easily assembled through the application of routing.

The above experiences made me, a DBA who later specialized in database optimization work, different from others. Many friends praise me for being "erudite", but in fact I am not so knowledgeable, just "miscellaneous". It is precisely because my work experience in the past thirty years is quite diverse, plus I have been unwilling to give up technology in the past thirty years, and I am still working on first-line database technology, so I can start compiling this "Database Miscellany" today. Miscellaneous books are the easiest to write and the most difficult to compile. It can be as imaginative as you like when writing it, but it’s not easy when you’re editing it. It is very difficult to be complicated but not cluttered. No matter how complicated it is, it must have a clear theme, and all the content can echo this theme, so that the miscellaneous book can look interesting. This is also a challenge for me, but I am still willing to accept this challenge. Since I started writing on the WeChat official account, there have been seven to eight hundred articles on databases. Although these articles are complex, they are all my thoughts, and whether they are right or wrong are the products of my own thoughts. Many things may not be completely correct, but it is also a kind of thinking. As long as people use their brains to think, these words should have some value. I hope these essays can be helpful to readers.
