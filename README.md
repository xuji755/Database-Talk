# Database-Talk

2015年一个做投资TOB业务的朋友找到我，说他觉得做系统优化服务是一个很有前途的业务。当时分析了一下我们的业务模式和收入情况，估算一下，投资价值特别大。当时我们俩憧憬把我们公司的业务扩大十几倍，就够创业板上市了。不过狂热之后我突然醒了过来，对他说：“这里面有个比较麻烦的事情，那就是怎么去培养出十倍的专家出来”。他也醒了过来，说“老白，你这个业务不值得投资，完全靠人，很难复制”。从那时候开始，我就在想能不能把专家脑子里的东西变成一个自动化的工具，从2016年开始我就想启动一个数据库运维知识自动化工具的开发，只不过一直没能如愿。2017年基石数据成立才让这件事情有了可能性。在2017年下半年我就在公司里推动开发这个产品。一晃5年过去了，D-SMART也初步具有了我在15年想有的能力。只不过运维知识自动化需要有大量的用户案例和数据作为基础，才能更为快速的发展。因此在2022年8月，我们推出了DBAIOPS社区，并在社区里提供D-SMART社区版的免费下载。发展DBAIOPS社区的最终目的是让更多的有数据库深度运维需求的朋友能够通过我们的工具，利用我们的专家知识库去运维自己的数据库系统，并能够让研发团队获得更多的案例数据，从而更加有效的开发知识库。因为知识库才是运维知识自动化系统的核心价值。我的这本书目前会以免费的形式发放，希望其中的一些内容会对大家有所帮助。也希望大家关注DBAIOPS社区，并下载我们的社区版软件，加入到这个大家庭中。利用大家的案例，帮助我们迭代出更好的知识库。多谢大家了！

自从开始开发工具，我接触了很多Oracle之外的数据库，从PostgreSQL到MySQL、达梦、TiDB、Oceanbase、GaussDB等。了解他们的配置方式，理解他们的内部架构，掌握他们的优化方法，学习他们的故障定位。在这些年里，我对数据库的理解又上了一个层次，也常常有所感悟。不过这些感悟都是零零碎碎的，无法写成一本像《DBA的思想天空》那样的书。不过我依然觉得我应该把这些思想记录下来，分享给需要的人。因此我决定在Github上陆续将我这些感悟写出来，分享给DBA们。

我会在谷歌翻译的帮助下按章节发布英文版本，以便于英文母语的朋友阅读，不过因为本人的英语水平有限，可能某些翻译质量不高。如有疏漏，敬请指教。

# Database-Talk

In 2015, a friend who was engaged in investment TOB business came to me and said that he thought system optimization services were a promising business. At that time, we analyzed our business model and income, and estimated that the investment value was extremely high. At that time, we both dreamed of expanding our company's business more than ten times, which would be enough to be listed on the GEM. But after the craze, I suddenly woke up and said to him: "There is a more troublesome thing here, and that is how to cultivate ten times as many experts." He also woke up and said, "Lao Bai, your business is not worth investing in. It relies entirely on people and is difficult to copy." Since then, I have been thinking about whether I can turn what is in the minds of experts into an automated tool. Since 2016, I have wanted to start the development of a database operation and maintenance knowledge automation tool, but I have never been able to do so. The establishment of Cornerstone Data in 2017 made this possible. In the second half of 2017, I promoted the development of this product in the company. Five years have passed, and D-SMART has begun to have the capabilities I wanted to have in 2015. However, operation and maintenance knowledge automation requires a large number of user cases and data as a basis to develop more rapidly. Therefore, in August 2022, we launched the DBAIOPS community and provided free downloads of the D-SMART community version in the community. The ultimate goal of developing the DBAIOPS community is to enable more friends who have in-depth database operation and maintenance needs to use our tools and our expert knowledge base to operate and maintain their own database systems, and to enable the R&D team to obtain more case data , thereby developing the knowledge base more effectively. Because the knowledge base is the core value of the operation and maintenance knowledge automation system. My book is currently being distributed for free, and I hope some of the content in it will be helpful to everyone. I also hope that everyone will pay attention to the DBAIOPS community, download our community version software, and join this big family. Use your cases to help us iterate a better knowledge base. Thank you all!

Since I started developing tools, I have come into contact with many databases other than Oracle, from PostgreSQL to MySQL, Dameng, TiDB, Oceanbase, GaussDB, etc. Understand their configuration methods, understand their internal architecture, master their optimization methods, and learn their fault location. Over the years, my understanding of databases has reached a new level, and I often gain insights. However, these insights are fragmented and cannot be written into a book like "DBA's Thought Sky". However, I still feel that I should record these thoughts and share them with those who need them. Therefore, I decided to write down these insights on Github and share them with DBAs.

I will publish the English version by chapter with the help of Google Translate for the convenience of English-speaking friends. However, due to my limited English proficiency, the quality of some translations may not be high. If there are any omissions, please advise.
